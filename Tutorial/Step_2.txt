✅ Step 2: Setting Up React
There are 2 common ways to start:

Option 1: Using create-react-app (CRA) — Local Setup (Beginner Friendly)
Option 2: Using CodeSandbox — Online (No Installation)
Let’s start with Option 1. If you’d prefer online (Option 2), let me know!

💻 Option 1: Create a React App (Local Setup)
You'll need:

Node.js installed: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)

A code editor, like VS Code
🧱 Step-by-step:
Open Terminal / Command Prompt

Run this command:
npx create-react-app my-first-react-app
This will create a folder my-first-react-app with everything set up

Go into your project:
cd my-first-react-app
Start the development server:

npm start
App will open in the browser at http://localhost:3000 showing the React logo.


🧪 What’s Inside the Project?
Your folder structure will look like this:

my-first-react-app/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── App.js        ← Your main component
│   ├── index.js      ← Renders App into root div
├── package.json


✅ Try Editing:
Open src/App.js, and change:

<h1>Hello React!</h1>
Save — the browser updates automatically. 🔁🔥
