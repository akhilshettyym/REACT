🔹 Step 1: What is React?
➤ React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Created by Facebook, it's widely used in modern web development to build fast, interactive UIs — like what you see on Instagram, Netflix, or even this portfolio you're building.

✅ Why Use React?
Feature	Explanation
⚛️ Component-Based	    Break UI into reusable chunks called components
🚀 Fast	                React uses a Virtual DOM for faster updates
🧠 Declarative	        You describe the UI and React handles the DOM
🔄 Reactive	            UI updates automatically when data (state) changes
🔌 Ecosystem	        Tons of tools, libraries, and community support

👨‍💻 Without React (Vanilla JS):
You manually select DOM elements, write document.createElement, update styles, etc.

Example:
const h1 = document.createElement('h1');    ➡️ Creates a new <h1> HTML element in memory (but not yet visible in the DOM).
h1.textContent = "Hello World";             ➡️ Sets the text inside the <h1> element to "Hello World"
document.body.appendChild(h1);              ➡️ Adds (or "appends") this newly created <h1> element to the actual HTML page's <body>.


⚛️ With React:
You write a component that returns JSX (a syntax that looks like HTML), and React takes care of rendering and updating the DOM.

Example:
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}

Then you render it like this:
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Hello />);
