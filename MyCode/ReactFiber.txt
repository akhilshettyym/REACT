Introduction to React Fiber
React Fiber is a new core algorithm introduced in React to improve how updates and rendering are handled. It’s a smarter way for React to decide what to update and when.

Why Was React Fiber Created?
The old React algorithm (called the Reconciliation algorithm) worked fine for simple apps but struggled with complex features like:

Animations
Smooth UI updates
Managing user interactions (like scrolling and clicking)
React Fiber fixes these problems by:

Breaking the rendering work into small chunks
Spreading the work across multiple frames (instead of doing everything at once)
Assigning priority to different updates (e.g., user input > background work)
Key Features of Fiber:
Incremental Rendering – Breaks rendering into smaller steps to avoid freezing the app.
Pausing & Resuming Work – Can pause rendering and resume it later if something more important comes up.
Priority-Based Updates – User interactions (like typing) are prioritized over less important tasks.
Concurrency – Handles multiple updates at once without slowing down the app.
Reusing Work – If the same update comes in before the last one finishes, Fiber can reuse the work already done.
How It Works (Simple Analogy):
Imagine React is like a painter painting a wall.
The old algorithm would force the painter to finish the whole wall in one go (which could take a long time).
Fiber lets the painter take breaks, handle urgent tasks (like fixing a drip), and come back later to continue.
Why It’s Important:
React Fiber makes your app feel smoother and more responsive.
It ensures that user interactions remain fast even when complex updates are happening.
It’s the foundation for new features like React Suspense and Concurrent Mode.
In Short:
React Fiber = Smarter and faster updates = Better user experience
